Architectural Decision Records (ADR)

This project uses the Architectural Decision Record (ADR) process to document important architectural and technical decisions over time. Each ADR captures the context, alternatives, decision, and consequences for a specific design choice. This provides a transparent, traceable log of the evolution of the system.

What is an ADR?

An ADR (Architectural Decision Record) is a short document that explains:
	•	What decision was made
	•	Why it was made
	•	What alternatives were considered
	•	What are the implications of the decision
	•	Who made the decision and when

This makes the decision-making process more transparent and easier to revisit later.

Where are ADRs stored?


Example:
All ADRs are stored in the decisions/ directory, numbered and titled by topic.

decisions/
├── 0001-use-go.md
├── 0002-support-kubernetes.md
├── 0003-configurable-loadplan-yaml.md

Each ADR follows a consistent format.
